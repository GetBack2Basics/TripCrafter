Trip Crafter ‚úàÔ∏è
Trip Crafter is a collaborative web application designed to help you plan and manage your travel itineraries. It allows users to create, update, and track various details of their trips, including dates, locations, accommodation, and booking statuses. The data is stored publicly within the application, making it easy to share and collaborate with travel companions.

It has been created entirely using LLM's with some tech stacks the author had never used before. The prompts can be seen at https://gemini.google.com/app/9b31fbc8fff71c8c

üöÄ Getting Started
This application is designed to be easily deployed using services like Netlify, especially when connected to a GitHub repository.

Prerequisites
You don't need to install anything locally on your computer to run this app, as it's designed for cloud-based development and deployment.

Deployment with Netlify
Repository Setup: Ensure this GitHub repository (https://github.com/GetBack2Basics/TripCrafter) contains the full React project structure (including public/, src/, package.json, etc.).

Connect to Netlify:

Log in to your Netlify account.

Click "Add new site" -> "Import an existing project."

Select "GitHub" and authorize Netlify to access this repository.

Choose the TripCrafter repository.

Confirm the build settings (usually auto-detected for React: Build command npm run build, Publish directory build).

Click "Deploy site."

Access Your App: Netlify will automatically build and deploy your application, providing you with a live URL to share! Subsequent pushes to the main branch will trigger automatic redeployments.

Developing with GitHub Codespaces (Optional)
If you want to contribute or develop without a local setup:

Open in Codespaces: On your GitHub repository page, click the "< > Code" button and select "Create codespace on main".

Install Dependencies: Once the Codespace loads, open the integrated terminal and run npm install.
