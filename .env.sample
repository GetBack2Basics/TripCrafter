# Copy this file to .env and fill in values for local testing with Netlify Dev
# Example:
# UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY=your_unsplash_access_key_here

# When running locally with Netlify Dev, Netlify will expose these to functions
# as process.env.UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY. If you prefer CRA-style vars, also set:
# REACT_APP_UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY=your_unsplash_access_key_here

# Optional flag to force using server-side proxy even without a key
# USE_SERVER_DISCOVER=true
