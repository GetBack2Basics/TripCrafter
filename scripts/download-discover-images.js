// Deprecated: this project now uses dynamic Unsplash image URLs at runtime (source.unsplash.com).
// The original download script has been left as a stub to avoid accidental offline downloads.
// DO NOT RUN. If you need deterministic, pre-downloaded images, implement a separate, audited
// script that requests Unsplash API with a valid access key and obeys Unsplash terms.

console.log('scripts/download-discover-images.js is deprecated â€” images are loaded from Unsplash dynamically.');
